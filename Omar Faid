Who can catch lighting in a bottle? Set fire to water?
Comin' out the nozzle on the fire hose? Flyer than swatters?

Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup 'em
Spin around to freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em

There's a storm comin' that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start to bug, prick, you better flee 'cause I get ticked
